    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is my "About Me" page.  Hope you like it!</p>
      <p>My wife and three children help me run our small business making art supplies.  I'm also pursuing a computer science degree with what little spare time I have.</p>
      <p>I have an Associate's degree in Computer Engineering Technology, and have worked as a computer programmer in the past.  As my kids came along, I felt that being there for them was more important than computer programming, and I have been making art supplies for the last 12 years.  Now that they're older, I'm ready to jump back into development!</p>
      <p>The most important thing for me is keeping my family taken care of, preferably with a job that is satisfying and rewarding.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>I enjoy video games and I watch too much television.  Sometimes I pick up a guitar and try to remember how to play it.</p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>I'd love to run my own business as a developer of some sort.  Running a small business is scary, but to me the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>My musical tastes are pretty varied.  In the last week I've listened to Nirvana, Oysterhead, Tom Waits, The Specials, The Skints, Inner Terrestrials, and probably more.</p>
